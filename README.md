## Draftodon Instructions

## Support Development

I developed these functions and the Action Group in my free time to help myself and you to integrate Drafts with Mastodon to improve workflows and remove friction from processes. üöÄ

Draftodon is completely free to use for you. However if this Action Group is useful for you and supports your workflows you can give something back to support development.
I enjoy a good coffee ‚òïÔ∏è (weather at home or in an actual coffee shop) and love pizza üçï.
